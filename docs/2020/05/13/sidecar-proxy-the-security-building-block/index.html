<h3 id="the-proxy-pattern">The Proxy Pattern</h3>
<p>Wikipedia gives us a good detailed definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In computer programming, the proxy pattern is a software design pattern. A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. The proxy could interface to anything: a network connection, a large object in memory, a file, or some other resource that is expensive or impossible to duplicate. In short, a proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serving object behind the scenes [&hellip;]</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In brief, a Proxy is:</p>
<ol>
<li>A software design pattern.</li>
<li>An interface to something.</li>
<li>Agnostic, because It could interface to anything.</li>
<li>A wrapper or agent.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional logic. In the proxy, extra functionality can be provided, for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked. For the client, usage of a proxy object is similar to using the real object, because both implement the same interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a proxy can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Forward the load.</li>
<li>Provide additional logic.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a-single-pattern-with-multiple-uses">A single pattern with multiple uses</h3>
<p>There are several products that implements the proxy pattern, between them we have:</p>

It will often handle a request by invoking multiple services and aggregating the responses. Here some API Gateway products: Kong API Gateway, Netflix Zuul, WSO2 API Manager, Mule Runtime (it embeds an API Gateway), Amazon API Gateway, etc.</td>

Since the Ingress Controller is an important element in the traffic management in K8s Cluster, It is able to provide features such as Load Balancing, WAF, API Gateway, etc. Some products are: Azure Application Gateway, Envoy Proxy based (Ambassador API Gateway, Gloo, Contour, Istio, Kong Kuma, etc.), NGINX Ingress, HAProxy Ingress, Linkerd, Traefik, etc.</td>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/DevGuide/blob/master/02-Design/01-Principles%20of%20Security%20Engineering.md">OWASP Security Design Principles</a> provide a good framework to identify security concerns in when designing a Cloud Native Application specifically if it is container-based, and It will help us to outline the Security use cases.</p>

<p>As you can see above, a single Sidecar implementation <strong>potentialy can address all security concerns</strong> what <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/DevGuide/blob/master/02-Design/01-Principles%20of%20Security%20Engineering.md">OWASP Security Design Principles</a> states.</p>

<p>The only difficult is be able to identify the security use case and understand your own technical constrains (i.e. don&rsquo;t introduce aditional hops, able to modify main application, etc.). A good reading about this is the Christian Posta&rsquo;s presentation published on Nov 19, 2019 (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ceposta/the-truth-about-the-service-mesh-data-plane">The Truth About the Service Mesh Data Plane</a>).</p>
<h3 id="why-a-security-building-block">Why a Security Building Block?</h3>
<h4 id="what-is-a-building-block">What is a Building Block?</h4>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_block">Wikipedia</a>, there are multiples meanings, this for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Components that are part of a larger system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the building blocks are a set of pieces or elements that form a unified whole. And applying this concept to Security in Cloud Native Applications, the Sidecar Proxy is the vehicle to embed one or all security controls according the security use cases identified above.<br>
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>My application requires TLS but it can&rsquo;t handle its termination, then a sidecar proxy could implement that feature.</li>
<li>My application exposes a service over HTTP, but HTTPS is mandatory, then a sidecar proxy could reject HTTP requests.</li>
<li>My application must be accessed over TLS (HTTPS) with Mutual TLS Authn with a specific type of X.509 Cert, then a sidecar proxy switch to HTTPS and validate the client TLS Cert.</li>
<li>I want to simulate the disruption of my service, a sidecar proxy in front of that service can simulate an error.</li>
<li>I want to implement a mini Web Application Firewall (WAF) only for a microservice, a sidecar proxy could inspect (mediate) incoming traffic and identify DoS or flooding attacks.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Different type of Proxies and different combinations are required to address different requirements. For example, if your API requires <code>throttling</code> and <code>retries</code>, an API Gateway is most adecuate, but if <code>circuit breaking</code> is required, an API Gateway and a sidecar proxy for each microservice are needed.</li>
<li>Use a Sidecar Proxy implementation only to address any or all security concerns. Using an only implementation reduce the complexity and improve the mantenability. In this conext, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io">Envoy Proxy</a> is the right implementation (see below list).</li>
<li>End-to-end security (along the traffic) is only possible if security is implemented in both endpoints, but using a sidecar proxy always is mandatory in the last-mile.</li>
<li>If you are going to use a combination of proxies, try to use those that implement a standard interface (API) or implement the &ldquo;Adapter Pattern&rdquo;. In other words, choose an API Gateway and Sidecar Proxy if both speak the same idiom or if both implement the same Management API. For example, Gloo (as API Gateway and Ingress Controller) and Envoy Proxy. Other combination is Ambassador (API Gateway) and Envoy.</li>
</ol>
