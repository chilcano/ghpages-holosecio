      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 25th I had the opportunity to collaborate with a workshop at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/DevOpsPlayground/&#34;&gt;The DevOps Playground&lt;/a&gt; Meetup about How to use TLS to authenticate and authorize communications between and to Microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event was very special for me because it was my second event in English after many years. There are many things to improve, but that does not discourage me from following this path, in fact I am already preparing the next workshop.
From here I thank &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/DevOpsPlayground/&#34;&gt;The DevOps Playground&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ecs.co.uk&#34;&gt;ECS&lt;/a&gt; for supporting me before, during and after the event, I also thank everyone who attended the playground, and if you want read the presentation, go through the code or watch the playground session again, below you will find the details:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On October 15th, 2020 I had the opportunity to participate at &lt;a href=&#34;https://apiaddictsday.apiaddicts.org/&#34;&gt;API Addicts Days 20&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest evento of API experts in Latam and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://holisticsecurity.io/assets/img/20210621-apiaddictsdays20-l4-l7-gateway-para-proteger-tu-data.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event was important for me because it allowed me come back to online conferences in Spanish bringing a Security topic to The API World.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sidecar Proxy: The Security Building Block</title>
      <link>https://holisticsecurity.io/2020/05/13/sidecar-proxy-the-security-building-block/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as a HTTP reverse proxy is sitting in front of a web application and a sidecar is attached to a motorcycle; a sidecar proxy is attached to a main application to extend or add functionality. A Sidecar Proxy is an application design pattern which abstracts certain features, such as inter-service communications, monitoring and &lt;strong&gt;security&lt;/strong&gt;, away from the main application to ease its maintainability, resilience and scalability of the application as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will show you how to use the Sidecar Pattern to address security challenges in the Cloud Native Applications.&lt;/p&gt;
