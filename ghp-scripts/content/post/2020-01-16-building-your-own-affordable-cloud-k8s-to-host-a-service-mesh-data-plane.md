title: Building your own affordable K8s to host a Service Mesh - Part 1
url: /2020/01/16/building-your-own-affordable-cloud-k8s-to-host-a-service-mesh-data-plane
---
I want to build a Container-based Cloud to deploy any kind of workload (RESTful API, Microservices, Event-Driven, Functions, etc.) but it should be affordable, ready to use, reliable, secure and productionable. This means:

- Productionable: should be fully functional and ready to be used as a production environment.
- Reliable and Secure: able to improve the security level by implementing more security controls, at least fully isolated secure private networking.
- Affordable: cheaper.
- Ready to use: able to be automated (DevOps and IaC) with a mature management API.

Below a high level architecture of Container-based Cloud I want to get. I will focus on the Service Mesh Data Plane.

These requeriments restric some options, all of them using any Public Cloud Provider, but considering the [AWS Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot) and [Google Cloud Preemptible VM Instances](https://cloud.google.com/preemptible-vms). Unfortunately Microsoft Azure only provides Low-Priority VMs to be used from Azure Batch Service. But if you are new user, you could apply for using the Free Tier in all of 3 Cloud Providers.

For further information, you can read these articles:

* [Understanding Excess Cloud Capacity: Amazon EC2 Spot vs. Azure Low-Priority VM vs. Google Preemptible VM vs IBM Transient Servers](https://spotinst.com/blog/amazon-ec2-spot-vs-azure-lpvms-vs-google-pvms-vs-ibm-transient-servers/) - By Zev Schonberg, 2019-Mar
* [Cloud vendor free tiers compared: AWS vs Azure vs Google Cloud Platform](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3427685/cloud-vendor-free-tiers-compared--aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-platform.html) - By Scott Carey, 2018-May

The automation can be achieved using Terraform, Python, Bash, etc. and the 2 Cloud Providers (AWS and Google Cloud) choosen for this project have a mature Management API which can be used to automatization and configuration.

## How much will the Kubernetes Cluster cost me?

Well, It is too difficult to know the cost exactly right now, however, I can estimate what it will cost me for a month. Below you can see two images, the first one is the High level AWS design and the next one is the approximate cost of the all AWS resources used during a month.

[![](/assets/img/20200122-service-mesh-01-affordablek8s-aws-arch.png "Kubernetes Cluster using AWS Spot Instances")](/assets/img/20200122-service-mesh-01-affordablek8s-aws-arch.png){:target="_blank"}

You can see below that my K8s Cluster using AWS Spot instances will cost approx. `6.79 Euros`, that includes:
* Instances EC2 Spot: 2
* Type: m1.small
* AZ: us-east-1
* S3 Storage 1GB
* S3 Put/Copy/Post / mo(K): 96
* S3 Get and other / mo(K): 2880
* Backup into S3 cron expression: "*/15 * * * *"

## What about Digital Ocean, Hetzner Cloud, Scaleway and other Providers?

Yes, all of them are worthy of being considered too and will do it in next blog posts, but let's start with AWS and Google first. 
Ah, if you don't want to wait, I suggest you read the [Kubernetes clusters for the hobbyist](https://github.com/hobby-kube/guide) guide written by Patrick Stadler. This guide explains how to build a Kubernetes Cluster on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com), [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/) and/or [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com), and this guide is accompanied by a fully automated cluster setup based on Terraform recipes. The guide suggests that [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com) are other viable options.

## Cheap doesn't mean unreliable, doesn't mean unsecure

Choose a cloud provider based on a few criteria such as trustworthiness, reliability, pricing and data center location is critical for this project. Security is a must, create a cluster in a private network doesn't mean it is secure. I will create multiple clusters to host different kind of workloads, then they should be isolated, implement secure private networking and implement Access Control (Authentication and Authorization).

## Let's do it

Then, in this post I will explain how to create an affordable Data Plane in AWS, to do that I'm going to use the [Really cheap Kubernetes cluster on AWS with kubeadm](https://github.com/cablespaghetti/kubeadm-aws) Guide's [Sam Weston](https://cablespaghetti.github.io) which will create a Kubernetes Cluster in AWS by using [AWS EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), Bash and [Helm](https://helm.sh) for automation, External DNS and Nginx Ingress as a cheap ELB alternative, and [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io) for TLS certificates via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org). Other features implemented are:

* Automatic backup and recovery.
* Auto Scaling of worker nodes. 
* Persistent Volumes using General Purpose SSD (GP2) storage on [AWS EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs).

### Steps


**1) Terraform**


1. Download Terraform bundle.

   > I've attempted to use Terraform 12.x, but unfortunately Terraform scrips need to be tweaked before, for that, for this blog post I recommend download and install [Terraform 11.15-oci](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/) version.  
   > The `oci` suffix means that Terraform is compatible with [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/oci/guides/faq.html). 

2. Extract the downloaded `terraform` binary file and move it into a directory searched for executables.

   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~$ unzip ~/Downloads/terraform_0.11.15-oci_linux_amd64.zip 
 
   chilcano@inti:~$ sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
   
   chilcano@inti:~$ terraform -v
   Terraform v0.11.15-oci
   ```

**2) AWS (optional)**


Although AWS CLI isn't needed for the purpose of running Terraform, that will be useful in the next blog posts.

1. Install AWS CLI. It requires Pip 3.

   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~$ pip3 --version
   pip 18.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.7)
   
   chilcano@inti:~$ pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user
   
   chilcano@inti:~$ aws --version
   aws-cli/1.16.314 Python/3.7.5 Linux/5.3.0-26-generic botocore/1.13.50
   
   chilcano@inti:~$ which aws
   /home/chilcano/.local/bin/aws
   ```

2. Configure the AWS account.

   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~$ aws configure --profile affordablek8s01
   AWS Access Key ID [None]: <ACCESS-KEY-ID>
   AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <SECRET-ACCESS-KEY>
   Default region name [None]: us-west-2
   Default output format [None]: json
 
   chilcano@inti:~$ cat .aws/credentials 
   [affordablek8s01]
   aws_access_key_id = <ACCESS-KEY-ID>
   aws_secret_access_key = <SECRET-ACCESS-KEY>
   ```

3. Create a SSH key under the AZ where the resources will be created. In my case I'll create in `us-east-1` (Virginia) from the `AWS Web Console > NETWORK & SECURITY > Key Pairs`. This SSH key will be used to get access to all nodes created in AWS for that specific AZ.


**3) Create the Kubernetes Cluster in AWS using Terraform**


1. Clone the Github repo.

   You can clone the [forked GitHub repo](https://github.com/chilcano/kubeadm-aws){:target="_blank"} and switch to `0.2.1-chilcano` branch. 
   
   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos$ git clone https://github.com/chilcano/kubeadm-aws affordable-k8s-tf
   
   Cloning into 'affordable-k8s-tf'...
   remote: Enumerating objects: 327, done.
   remote: Total 327 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 327
   Receiving objects: 100% (327/327), 71.68 KiB | 638.00 KiB/s, done.
   Resolving deltas: 100% (210/210), done.
   
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos$ cd affordable-k8s-tf/
   
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ git tag -l
   0.1.0
   0.1.1
   0.1.2
   0.2.0
   0.2.1

   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ git branch -a
   * master
     remotes/origin/0.2.1-chilcano
     remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
     remotes/origin/master

   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ git branch -r
     origin/0.2.1-chilcano
     origin/HEAD -> origin/master
     origin/master
   ```
   Now, let's switch to `0.2.1-chilcano` branch.

   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ git checkout 0.2.1-chilcano
   Branch '0.2.1-chilcano' set up to track remote branch '0.2.1-chilcano' from 'origin'.
   Switched to a new branch '0.2.1-chilcano'

   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ git status
   On branch 0.2.1-chilcano
   Your branch is up to date with 'origin/0.2.1-chilcano'.
   
   nothing to commit, working tree clean
   ```
   
   > Alternatively to all above steps you can clone the `0.2.1-chilcano` branch only of GitHub repo as follow:
   > ```sh
   > chilcano@inti:~/git-repos$ git clone --single-branch --branch 0.2.1-chilcano https://github.com/chilcano/kubeadm-aws affordable-k8s-tf
   > ```

2. Update `variables.tf`.

   > 
   > Hard-coding any credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended. I recommend to provide your AWS credentials via `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.
   >  
   
   ```sh
   $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="an-access-key"
   $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="a-secret-key"
   ```
   
   In my case I'm not going to update any variables in `variables.tf`, I will overwrite them when running `terraform apply`. But if you want to do, the variables you have to modify are:
   
   * `cluster-name = "MY-CHEAP-K8S"`
   * `access_key = "ENV-VAR-VALUE-WILL-BE-READ"`
   * `secret_key = "ENV-VAR-VALUE-WILL-BE-READ"`
   * `k8s-ssh-key = "SSH-KEY-NAME-CREATED-IN-AWS-CONSOLE"`
   * `admin-cidr-blocks = "YOUR-PUBLIC-IP-ADDRESS/32"`
   * `region = "us-east-1"`
   * `master-instance-type = "m1.small"`
   * `worker-instance-type = "m1.small"`
   
   > 
   > If you change the `master-instance-type` and `worker-instance-type` values to `t2.micro` for example, that isn't going to work because the `t2.micro` AMIs are prepared to be autoscaled.
   >  

3. Update `main.tf` and initialize the Terraform Providers.

   I will update `main.tf` to configure the 2 Terraform providers (`aws` and `random`) with proper versions according `Terraform v0.11.15-oci` version:
   
   ```terraform
   provider "aws" {
     #version    = "~> 1.48"
     version    = "~> 2.44.0"
     access_key = "${var.access_key}"
     secret_key = "${var.secret_key}"
     region     = "${var.region}"
   }
   
   provider "template" {
     version    = "1.0.0"
   }
   
   provider "random" {
     #version    = "2.0.0"
     version    = "2.1.0"
   }
   ```
   
   Now, initialize Terraform.
   
   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ terraform init
   
   Initializing provider plugins...
   - Checking for available provider plugins on https://releases.hashicorp.com...
   - Downloading plugin for provider "template" (1.0.0)...
   - Downloading plugin for provider "random" (2.1.0)...
   - Downloading plugin for provider "aws" (2.44.0)...
   
   Terraform has been successfully initialized!
   
   You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
   any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
   should now work.
   
   If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
   rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
   commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   ```

4. Get the Terraform Plan.

   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ terraform plan \
     -var cluster-name="cheapk8s" \
     -var k8s-ssh-key="ssh-key-for-us-east-1" \
     -var admin-cidr-blocks="83.46.128.76/32" \
     -var region="us-east-1" \
     -var kubernetes-version="1.14.3"
   
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ terraform -v
   Terraform v0.11.15-oci
   + provider.aws v2.44.0
   + provider.random v2.1.0
   + provider.template v1.0.0
   
   Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
   is 0.12.19. You can update by downloading from www.terraform.io/downloads.html
   ```

5. Visual exploration of the AWS resources are going to be created by Terraform.

   Terraform is able to export all Terraform scripts into a file in [DOT format](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html), useful to generate a graph through [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org). All details are explained here ["Terraform - Command: graph"](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/graph.html).
   
   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ sudo apt install graphviz
   terraform graph | dot -Tsvg > your-graph.svg
   ```
   
   In my case I'm going to tweaking the DOT file to get a better graph. In fact, you can do it and once done, using an online service like this [Graphviz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline) generate SVG file.
   
   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ terraform graph -draw-cycles -module-depth=1 -type=apply > 20200116-service-mesh-02-affordable-k8s-aws-graph.dot
   ```
   
   > 
   > You can download my updated DOT file from here [20200116-service-mesh-02-affordable-k8s-aws-graph.dot](/assets/img/20200116-service-mesh-02-affordable-k8s-aws-graph.dot).
   > 

   [![Affordable K8s Data Plane hosted in AWS Graph](/assets/img/20200116-service-mesh-02-affordable-k8s-aws-graph.svg "Affordable K8s Data Plane hosted in AWS Graph")](/assets/img/20200116-service-mesh-02-affordable-k8s-aws-graph.svg){:target="_blank"}

6. Apply the Terraform Plan.

   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ terraform apply \
     -var cluster-name="cheapk8s" \
     -var k8s-ssh-key="ssh-key-for-us-east-1" \
     -var admin-cidr-blocks="83.46.128.76/32" \
     -var region="us-east-1" \
     -var kubernetes-version="1.14.3"
   ```
   
   And if you want to destroy all resources recently created by `terraform apply`, you can do it executing this:
   
   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ terraform destroy \
     -var cluster-name="cheapk8s" \
     -var k8s-ssh-key="ssh-key-for-us-east-1" \
     -var admin-cidr-blocks="83.46.128.76/32" \
     -var region="us-east-1" \
     -var kubernetes-version="1.14.3"
   ```

**4) Check the Kubernetes Cluster**

If we want to check the Kubernetes Cluster creation, we have to review the `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`. Before we should get remote access to Kubernetes Master host.

```sh
chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ chmod 400 ~/Downloads/ssh-key-for-us-east-1.pem
```

Now, getting remote access to Kubernetes Master host.

```sh
chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output master_dns) -i ~/Downloads/ssh-key-for-us-east-1.pem -- cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

```

**5) Access to Kubernetes Cluster**

If you want to know if your Kubernetes Cluster was created successfully, then you should do these checkings:

1. Check that there are no errors in `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log` log file.

   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output master_dns) -i ~/Downloads/ssh-key-for-us-east-1.pem -- cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
   ```

2. Check that `kubelet` has started successfully.

   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output master_dns) -i ~/Downloads/ssh-key-for-us-east-1.pem -- systemctl status kubelet
   ```

3. Finally, ask to Kubernetes to show all Cluster Nodes and its status.

   ```sh
   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output master_dns) -i ~/Downloads/ssh-key-for-us-east-1.pem -- kubectl get nodes
   
   NAME                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
   ip-10-0-100-154.ec2.internal   Ready    <none>   48m   v1.14.3
   ip-10-0-100-4.ec2.internal     Ready    master   49m   v1.14.3

   chilcano@inti:~/git-repos/affordable-k8s-tf$ ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output master_dns) -i ~/Downloads/ssh-key-for-us-east-1.pem -- kubectl cluster-info
   Kubernetes master is running at https://10.0.100.4:6443
   KubeDNS is running at https://10.0.100.4:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
   ```
