> Just mention that since Ubuntu 19.04 (kernel 5.0) the Magic Mouse works out of the box and not tweaking were needed.

> In Ubuntu 19.10 I installed and uninstalled `blueman`, if you did that, you had to restart/enable the bluetooth service. Here that is explained: [https://medium.com/@djorborn/bluetoothctl-failed-to-connect-org-bluez-error-failed-54040f12b4f8](https://medium.com/@djorborn/bluetoothctl-failed-to-connect-org-bluez-error-failed-54040f12b4f8)

```sh
chilcano@inti:~$ sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service
chilcano@inti:~$ sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service
Synchronizing state of bluetooth.service with SysV service script with /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable bluetooth
```
> Finally I made the decision to buy the [Logitech M590 Multi-Device Silent](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/m590-silent-wireless-mouse) mouse instead of trying using the Apple Magic Mouse with Ubuntu 19.10 because I was getting scrolling lag, anoying behaviour with scrolling and clicking, and continuous bluetooth disconnection.

> The Logitech M590 mouse can be use through bluetooth and unify receiver. It works in Ubuntu 19.10 and bluetooth by default, but not with unify receiver. To fix it I had to follow this information about [Solaar and Unify technology](https://lekensteyn.nl/logitech-unifying.html) in AskUbuntu forum: [Is Logitech's Unifying receiver supported?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/113984/is-logitechs-unifying-receiver-supported)

I hope this helps you.
